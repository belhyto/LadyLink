        Gender discrimination is any action that excludes or disadvantages people based on their gender. It includes actions that are deliberately unfair and actions that are unintentionally unfair.
        Gender discrimination is fueled by sexism, which is prejudice based on sex or gender. In most countries, sexism devalues women and femininity and privileges men and masculinity.
        Because gender relates to how someone feels, rather than their biological characteristics, anyone who identifies with a gender that their society deems less valuable can experience gender discrimination. This includes trans and other gender-expansive people.

        Gender discrimination is a source of stress, and like any other stressor, it can directly affect mental health.
        Research from 2020Trusted Source refers to a study in which women who reported experiencing gender discrimination in the past 12 months scored more highly than others on a depression screening tool.
        Depending on the situation, facing discrimination can also result in anxiety and psychological trauma.

        Gender discrimination can also lead to a person having worse living conditions and less access to the things that they need to survive and thrive.
        For example, in the United States, the gender pay gap means that women earn less than men overall — even when performing the same jobs. The pay gap is wider for women of color.
        Women also have higher levels of student debt, lower savings in retirement, and higher rates of poverty, in comparison to men.
        Not only does this cause more stress, it also reduces a person’s ability to afford fresh food, safe housing, and health insurance. This results in health inequity — avoidable and unfair differences in the health of marginalized groups, compared with privileged ones
